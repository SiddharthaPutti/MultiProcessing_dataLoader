# MultiProcessing_dataLoader
This is a data loader using multiprocessing in python using hydra config files.

THe goal of this repo is to use multiprocessing to load dataset. pytorch and other libraries have multiprocessing to load data, but i need to perform specific task and make more understanding over how multiprocessingin python works. 

I have also tried to use hydra to see how config files work and get hands on with industy prototyping of machine learning projects.
